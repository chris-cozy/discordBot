# Discord Bot ðŸ¤–
<h2>Description</h2>
These python scripts contain my first discord bot. 
I have heard that it is generally good to have your bot fill a niche and excel in it, but due to it being my first time coding a bot I decided to make it general purpose, a jack-of-all-trades.
This was to grant me some experience in all aspects/services, which allowed me to learn the basic processes behind each functionality. The project is structured like a microservice-based application. 
There is a main file, then a folder containing 'feature files'. Each 'feature file' contains the code for a specific feature. Then main file then loads in the 'feature files'.
Structuring the project this way allows the bot to remain online while the features are being edited, then updated in real-time through running a reload command in discord.
The purpose of this project was to further familiarize myself with the python language, the discord.py library, and the utilization and integration of APIs.
<h2>Features</h2>

- Send gifs (API)
- Mod functions (ban, kick, etc)
- Play music in a voice channel
- Chat with users
- Send random inspirational quotes (API)
- Send art
- Bank system, with slots game

<h2>Installation</h2>
This project cannot be self run by others due to certain credentials and API keys being needed. If creating your own bot, it can be used as a template and the credentials filled in with your own.

<h2>Developer Notes</h2>
May continue to clean any cruft in the code. 
This project was my first experience with the discord.py library, APIs, and python to a degree. Another first child of sorts. As such, the practices used may not be the most refined, but they are functional. As I learn more about the technologies I may update this project.
Inspired by certain discord youtube tutorials which detailed the discord.py library and its capabilities.
